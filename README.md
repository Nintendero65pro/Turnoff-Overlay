An overlay for Nintendo Switch to shutdown/restart your console, you can install it using tesla menu.

After you have tesla-menu installed in your console, place the ovl in SD/switch/.overlays/turnoff-overlay.ovl

##Why i would need that
Why? Idk just to test, feel free to use my code to make ur overlays but u probabbly want to use the example in libtesla which provides u alot of stuff to add in ur overlay :D, have fun homebrewing!

##How to build
First [configure your environment]([https://pages.github.com/](https://switch.homebrew.guide/homebrew_dev/introduction.html)https://switch.homebrew.guide/homebrew_dev/introduction.html)
then go to the root directory and do a beautiful:
